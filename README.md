## Overview Idea

###

**Create a website thats purpose is to document my current top 5 ice cream shops in WI. Users will have access to different webpages for my current top 3 choices to give them a sneak peak of the top contenders on the list. Users will be able to sign up for a mock Newsletter that would theoretically update them when I change the rankings. The site is simply called "Ice Cream Rankings"**

- Index.html: This is the homepage of my site. It contains a table with current rankings, locations, and if the shop is currently in season. Under this there is a list with links to my top 3 if the user doesn't want to use the navbar for some reason.
 
- Newsletter.html: Simple form for users to signup to recieve email and text alerts for our dynamic ranking system. Fields for email and phone number --> I use regex for validation.

- Belts.html: Sneakpeak of my 1st ranking shop in Wisconsin. Has a photo with caption and a few neat facts. Contains links to Facebook

- ScoopsHouse.html: Sneakpeak of my 2nd ranking shop in Wisconsin. Has a photo with caption and a few neat facts. Contains links to Facebook

- SweetnSalt.html Sneakpeak of my 3rd ranking shop in Wisconsin. Has two photos with captions and a few neat facts. Contains links to Sweet n Saulty Website and Facebook.


**Technical requirements?**
